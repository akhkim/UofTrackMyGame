Equitable use
- We don't provide any alternative uses, such as text to voice, or alternative 
color schemes, but we could incorporate these features to help improve equitable
use. we could also consider providing alternative languages or a more picture/symbol
based interface.

Flexibility in Use
- We could improve the flexibility in the use of our application by providing
alternative color schemes, languages, or text throughout our application.
Additionally, we could consider integrating our application with other apps
or allowing users to create plugins so that users can customize their experience.

Simple and Intuitive Use
- Our design is fairly simple and therefor straightforward to use. The application
opens to the search screen, and search by title, search by filters, and sorting
are clearly split into 3 sections, making for an intuitive design.

Perceptible Information
- On the game view, we show both the title of the game as well as the thumbnail of the
game, allowing a variety of audience to interpret the information. That being said,
we could improve by integrating the thumbnails into other aspects of the application.

Tolerance for Error
- Our application has a fairly high tolerance for error, as it the application will not
break or behave in an unexpected manner if something is misclicked or misinterpreted.
For example, you can enter your email multiple times if you fail to correctly spell
out your email the first time. You can also click the "Back" button to go back to
previous views.

Low Physical Effort
- For any query, our application only requires a few clicks, therefore making most
actions very low physical effort. For instance, searching by title only requires you
to type the title then hit the search button. We could make our app further low
physical effort by introducing voice-controlled commands.

Size and Space for Approach and Use
- This principle speaks to the providing users with appropriate <b>physical</b> space and size
for accessing all features. As such, it does not apply to our project.

Generally speaking, the audience of our project would be anybody who wants to
buy or plays games. In particular, our project can be marketed towards individuals 
that want to get good deal on video games. In particular, our project might appeal to those 
who are trying to save on expenses, such as university students, or people who are 
trying to discover some new (but cheap) games to play. 

It is likely that our project is less likely to be used by older individuals, given that
most people that play and enjoy video games are younger. Additionally, since our
application uses a lot of text, those that have difficulty reading English, such
as foreigners or people with dyslexia, might opt for a different platform to search 
for games. Finally, if an individual has no interest in video games, or has the funds
to buy any video game they desire, they may not see the point in using our 
application, making them unlikely users.
