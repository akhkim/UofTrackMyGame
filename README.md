## Project Goals
UofTrackMyGame is a game price searching application, where the user can search for a game, and the application compares the price of that game on various platforms to display the best available deal at that moment.

This project was initially created to provide better access to gaming for all, especially those who find it financially burdening to pay the full price for a game; Even for those who can afford the games, with the modern game prices continuously increasing, everyone would prefer to save as much as possible on such games, which is what UofTrackMyGame is for. 

UofTrackMyGame not only provides the best currently available price for the game you're looking for, but also allows you to search by various filters, including the availability of sale and metacritic score. Furthermore, the application has a feature to "Track the game", where you can set a desired price for a game and input your email. Then, when that game goes below the set desired price, the application will send you an email, allowing you to optimize your saving, without the need to constantly check the price of the game.

## Feedbacks
Make sure to read the following text on the qualities of a good feedback first, then submit your feedback [here](https://forms.gle/hCCgtfJsUAzHo5sq5)!

5 Qualities of a "Good" feedback:

1. Constructiveness
    1. Avoid general statements like "It's bad"; instead, provide details such as "The UI is difficult to navigate because the icons are not labeled."

2. Relevance
    1. The feedback should relate directly to the topic, product, or project.
    2. Avoid unrelated comments or feedback that does not address the purpose of the submission.

3. Actionability
    1. Provide a possible solution to the feedback
    2. Example: Instead of saying "I donâ€™t like this", suggest "Adding a search function could improve usability."

4. Specificity
    1. Use clear and concise language that avoids ambiguity.
    2. Feedback must clearly describe the issue, feature, or experience.

5. Politeness and Respect
    1. Maintain a professional and respectful tone, even when discussing challenges.
    2. Feedback containing offensive or disrespectful language will not be accepted.

## Contributions
To make the process of contributions and updating smoother, we recommend the following:

1. Fork this project repository and clone it to your local machine. (Read more About Forks)
Before working on any changes, try to sync the forked repository to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository.
2. On a new branch in your fork, work on a small focused change that only touches on a few files.
3. Run pre-commit and make sure all files have formatting fixed.
4. Package up a small bit of work that solves part of the problem into a Pull Request and send it out for review.
5. If you're lucky, we can merge your change into main without any problems. If there are changes to files you're working on, resolve them by:
    1. First try to rebase as suggested in these instructions.
    2. If rebasing feels too painful, merge as suggested in these instructions.
8. Once you've resolved conflicts (if any), finish the review and squash and merge your Pull Request.
9. Merge in your change and move on to a new issue or the second step of your current issue.
