### Project Goals
UofTrackMyGame is a game browsing application, where the user can search for a game, and the application compares the price of that game on various platforms to display the best available deal at that moment.

This project was initially created to provide better access to gaming for all, especially those who find it financially burdening to pay the full price for a game; Even for those who can afford the games, with the modern game prices continuously increasing, everyone would prefer to save as much as possible on such games, which is what UofTrackMyGame is for. 

UofTrackMyGame not only provides the best currently available price for the game you're looking for, but also allows you to search by various filters, including the availability of sale and metacritic score. Furthermore, the application has a feature to "Track the game", where you can set a desired price for a game and input your email. Then, when that game goes below the set desired price, the application will send you an email, allowing you to optimize your saving, without the need to constantly check the price of the game.
